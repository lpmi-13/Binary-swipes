# Binary Swipes

A React Native game for practising binary search. Nodes rush toward you
Guitar-Hero style — swipe left to go lower, swipe right to go higher, and
navigate the binary search tree to find the target number before time runs out.
Each level gets faster.

## How to play

The target number is shown at the top of the screen. You start at the root of
a binary search tree and must swipe your way down to that number.

| Swipe | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ◀ Left | Go to the lower (left) child |
| ▶ Right | Go to the higher (right) child |

Swipe the wrong way or run out of time → game over. Reach the target → level
complete. Every level increases speed and tree depth.

## Tech stack

| Animation | react-native-reanimated v3 |
| Gestures | react-native-gesture-handler |
| Navigation | expo-router |
| State | Zustand |
| Haptics / Sound | expo-haptics, expo-av |

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or later
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- For running on a physical device: the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app
- For running on an emulator: Android Studio with an AVD configured

## Running locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lpmi-13/Binary-swipes.git
cd Binary-swipes

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the Expo dev server
npm start
```

The Metro bundler will start and print a QR code. From there:

- **Physical device** — scan the QR code with the Expo Go app (Android or iOS)
- **Android emulator** — press `a` in the terminal (requires Android Studio + a running AVD)
- **iOS simulator** — press `i` (macOS only, requires Xcode)

## Building an APK

The `android/` directory is committed to the repo, so builds use Gradle
directly — no Expo account, no EAS CLI, no secrets required.

### Locally (one-off)

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK is written to `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Transfer it
to an Android device and install it directly.

### Via GitHub Actions (automatic)

Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`. It installs
dependencies, runs `./gradlew assembleRelease` on a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu
runner, and uploads the result as a downloadable artifact. No secrets needed.

After the workflow completes, go to the Actions tab → the latest run →
**Artifacts** → download `binary-swipes-apk-<sha>` → unzip → install the APK.

### Updating native config

The `android/` directory was generated by `npx expo prebuild` and is kept in
sync automatically. Any push that modifies `app.json` triggers the
`sync-android-prebuild` workflow, which re-runs prebuild and commits the
updated `android/` files back to the branch.

If you need to sync manually (e.g. after a local `app.json` change before
pushing):

```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform android --no-install
```

Then commit the updated `android/` files.

## Difficulty curve

| Level | Tree depth | Approach speed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 (7 nodes) | 2.2 s |
| 3 | 3 | 1.6 s |
| 5 | 4 (15 nodes) | 1.2 s |
| 7 | 5 (31 nodes) | 0.9 s |
| 10+ | 6 (63 nodes) | 0.55 s (floor) |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Persistent high score (AsyncStorage)
- [ ] Sound effects (swipe, correct, wrong, level-up)
- [ ] Particle trail on approaching nodes
- [ ] Colour theme unlocks per level bracket
- [ ] Google Play Store release
